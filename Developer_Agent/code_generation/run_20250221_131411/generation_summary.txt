Code Generation Summary
==================================================

Requirements:
{
  "Title": "Image Preprocessing as per Model",
  "Description": "As a user, I want the system to perform image preprocessing (standardizing spatial and bit resolution through resizing and normalization) so that input images are ready for AI model training or inferencing (AI prediction).",
  "AcceptanceCriteria": [
    "Pre-processing should successfully be implemented on images with the following bit representations: 1-bit, 8-bit,16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit.",
    "The pre-processing system shall be able to resize the input images into the resolution required by the AI model.",
    "The pre-processing system shall be able to normalize the input image data into appropriate pixel datatype required by the AI model.",
    "When pre-processing is successful for the training dataset, the data shall be sent further for batch creation.",
    "When pre-processing is successful for inferencing (prediction) dataset, the data shall be sent for model inferencing."
