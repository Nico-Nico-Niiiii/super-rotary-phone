It is designed to be used with the \nBrady and Tachy demo mode on the programmer and with de-identified patient case \nstudies which can be provided by your local BSC representative.\n■  If the demo mode is used no data will be present.\n■  \u0007De-identified patient case studies consist of stored EGMs, diagnostic data, and up to \none year of trending information.\nUse the Table of Contents to quickly locate specific information or to gain an overall \nunderstanding of the topics/screens contained in the workbook. Note that the topics \nhave been assigned different colors and are organized by these colors throughout the \nguide.\nBelow each software illustration is a brief description of what is being displayed on \nscreen and/or steps for you to follow. \nThe Information contained here is not intended to replace the Instruction (or other) manual.

    "content": "INDICATIONS, SAFETY AND WARNINGS\nLATITUDETM Programming System, Model 3300\nLATITUDE™ PROGRAMMER\nIntended Use The LATITUDE Programming System is intended for use in hospital and clinical environments to communicate with Boston Scientific implantable systems. The software in use controls all communication \nfunctions for the PG. For detailed software application instructions, refer to the associated product literature for the PG being interrogated.\n Contraindications The LATITUDE Programming System is contraindicated for use with any PG other than a Boston Scientific PG. For contraindications for use related to the PG, refer to the associated product literature \nfor the PG being interrogated. \nThe PSA application is contraindicated for use with any programming system other than the Boston Scientific Model 3300 LATITUDE Programming System.\nThe following uses of the PSA are contraindicated:\n• With AV conduction disorders; atrial single-chamber pacing\n• With competing intrinsic rhythms; asynchronous modes\n• With chronic atrial tachycardia as well as chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter; modes with atrial control (DDD, VDD)\n• With poor tolerance of high ventricular rates (e.g., with angina pectoris); tracking modes (i.e., atrial control modes) and propensity for atrial tachycardia\n• Use as an external pacemaker\nWarnings The use of any cables or accessories with the LATITUDE Programming System other than those specified by Boston Scientific could result in increased electromagnetic emissions, decreased electromagnetic \nimmunity, or electrical shock of the LATITUDE Programming System. Keep all RF communications equipment at least 30 cm (12 in) away from the Model 3300 Programmer. Do not simultaneously touch the patient and any \naccessible LATITUDE Programming System connector or exposed conductor.  To avoid the risk of electric shock, only connect the Programmer’s Model 6689 Power Adapter to a grounded/earthed power outlet. When accessing \nthe battery, ensure that power to the Programmer is turned off. Do not touch the metal clips on the patient cable or the pacing lead. Discharge any electrical static charge on your person by touching a grounded metal surface \nbefore touching the patient, the patient cables, or the device. Unused PSA cable connections contacting conductive surfaces can induce electrical currents into the patient’s heart. Electrocautery can induce electrical currents \nin the PSA cables that can be conducted into the patient’s heart. Never stack the Programmer on top of an electrocautery system or associated components. Do not drape electrocautery components or cables on or near the \nProgrammer or associated cables and components.  Whenever possible disconnect the PSA cables from the pacing leads when performing an electrocautery procedure. If the Programmer is connected to the patient during an \nelectrocautery procedure, check its operation afterwards. If the Programmer experiences an issue that causes an error condition, the Programmer will need to be power cycled. Use of the Model 3300 Programmer adjacent or \nstacked with other equipment should be avoided because it could result in improper operation. The Programmer is non-sterile and cannot be sterilized. Operation of the LATITUDE Programming System with physiological signals \nthat are lower than the minimum detectable amplitude may cause inaccurate results. The LATITUDE Programming System is MR Unsafe and must  remain outside the MRI site Zone III (and higher) as defined by the American \nCollege of Radiology Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices. When activating PSA Burst Pacing, which may cause unpredictable arrhythmias, always have cardiac emergency equipment in an operational status available \nfor immediate life support.   The LATITUDE Programming System is designed and tested to be defibrillation safe. The PSA cable must be disconnected from the lead(s) before using external defibrillation. If the patient is pacer \ndependent and the Programmer encounters a fault condition, pacing operation continues unless the fault was in the PSA component itself. For this reason, always have external pacing equipment available for patient back-up. \nOperating the Programmer with a depleted internal battery or no battery can suspend Programmer function if AC power is temporarily interrupted. Always have external cardiac pacing equipment in an operational status avail-\nable for immediate life support. Always have external defibrillation equipment and medical personnel skilled in CPR available during implant and follow up testing. If not terminated in a timely fashion, an induced ventricular \ntachyarrhythmia can result in the patient’s death. Single chamber atrial modes are contraindicated for patients with impaired AV conduction. Abruptly terminating pacing may result in extended periods of asystole in some \npatients. Pacing threshold testing implies loss of capture. Incorrect positioning of the protective silicone rubber sleeves over the PSA cable clip(s) can cause unintended electrical connections that can impair cable function and \nendanger the patient. Moisture or wet cables can impair cable function and endanger the patient.  Before cleaning and disinfecting the Programmer surfaces, power down the device and disconnect the external power supply.  \nIf this equipment is used in a residential environment, the equipment might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The Model 6753 Battery is a Lithium-ion battery and as such, is deemed a \nDangerous Good in regards to shipping. Do not touch the screen while the Programmer is powering up, as this may cause the area that you touched to become unresponsive when pressed later on. \nPrecautions For specific information on precautions, read the following sections of the product labeling: General, Preparations for Use, Maintenance, Troubleshooting and Handling.\nAdverse Effects The following list includes the possible adverse effects associated with programming pulse generators described in this information: Asystole, Atrial arrhythmia, Bradycardia, Tachycardia and  \nVentricular arrhythmia.\n92436264 (Rev. A)\nCaution Federal law (USA) restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician. Rx only. Prior to use, please see the complete “Directions for Use” for more information on Indications, Contraindications, Warn-\nings, Precautions, Adverse Events, and Operator’s Instructions\n34\nRhythm Management \n300 Boston Scientific Way \nMarlborough, MA 01752-1234 \nwww.bostonscientific.com\nMedical Professionals:  \n1.800.CARDIAC (227.3422) \nPatients and Families:  \n1.866.484.3268\n© 2020 Boston Scientific Corporation  \nor its affiliates.
