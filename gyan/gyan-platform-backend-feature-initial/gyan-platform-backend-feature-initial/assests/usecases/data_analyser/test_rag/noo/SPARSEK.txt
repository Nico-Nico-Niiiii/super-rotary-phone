SPARSEK Attention is a method designed to make Transformers work more efficiently with long sequences. Normally, Transformers take a lot of time and memory to compare every word in a sequence with every other word, which becomes very slow when the sequences are long.

SPARSEK fixes this by only selecting a few important comparisons (key-value pairs) for each word instead of comparing all of them. It uses a scoring system to pick the most important ones, making the process much faster and using less memory.

This method still works well for tasks like language modeling, speeds up both training and prediction, and can be easily added to existing large models with only a little fine-tuning.

The SPARSEK Attention mechanism is designed to address the challenges of processing long sequences in autoregressive Transformers, which typically face issues of high computational cost and memory usage due to the nature of self-attention. Self-attention has quadratic complexity because every token in a sequence needs to attend to every other token, which becomes inefficient with long inputs.

SPARSEK Attention simplifies this by using a scoring network and a top-k mask to select a limited, constant number of key-value pairs (KV pairs) for each query. This reduces the computational burden, leading to linear time complexity (as opposed to quadratic) and constant memory usage during the generation of sequences. This approach ensures efficient processing without sacrificing performance.

Experiments show that SPARSEK Attention not only speeds up training and inference compared to previous methods but also integrates well into large pre-trained models (like LLMs) with minimal adjustments. It's particularly useful for tasks like language modeling and managing long-range dependencies. The code for SPARSEK Attention will be made publicly available.Introduction
