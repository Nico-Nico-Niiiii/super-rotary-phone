# Relationship-Enhanced Integrated Solution

This is an automatically generated integrated solution that combines functionality from multiple modules,
with enhanced documentation of relationships between functions and classes.

## Architecture Overview

The solution consists of the following modules, each with distinct responsibilities:

### US_171_code
None

Entry Points:
- `post_dicom_sr_details`
- `get_dicom_sr`

Key Functions:
- `validate_patient_id`: Validate patient ID format
  - Calls: re.match, logger.error
  - Called by: post_dicom_sr_details, get_dicom_sr
- `fetch_dicom_sr_from_db`: Fetch DICOM SR from the database
  - Calls: engine.connect, logger.warning, logger.error, HTTPException
  - Called by: post_dicom_sr_details, get_dicom_sr
- `fetch_dicom_image_from_pacs`: Fetch DICOM image from PACS server
  - Calls: requests.get, response.raise_for_status, response.json, logger.error, HTTPException
  - Called by: post_dicom_sr_details
- `perform_ai_inference`: Perform AI inference on DICOM image
  - Calls: requests.post, response.raise_for_status, response.json, logger.error, HTTPException
  - Called by: post_dicom_sr_details
- `post_dicom_sr_details`: Post DICOM SR details
  - Calls: validate_patient_id, fetch_dicom_sr_from_db, fetch_dicom_image_from_pacs, perform_ai_inference
- `get_dicom_sr`: Get DICOM SR by patient ID
  - Calls: validate_patient_id, logger.info, fetch_dicom_sr_from_db, cache.__contains__, cache.__setitem__
- `test_validate_patient_id`: No documentation available
  - Calls: validate_patient_id

## Integration Strategy

The integration follows these principles:

1. **Dependency-Based Execution**: Functions are called in an order that respects their dependencies
2. **Module Isolation**: Each module maintains its own namespace to prevent conflicts
3. **Coordinated Execution**: The main execution orchestrates the flow across modules
