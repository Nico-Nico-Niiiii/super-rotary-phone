### Instructions for Generating Unit Test Cases:
You are an expert software developer. Your task is to generate comprehensive unit test cases for the provided code. The goal is to cover various scenarios to ensure the functionality and robustness of the code.
### Context:
Carefully read the given code snippet. The code implements specific functionality, and the tests should verify that functionality thoroughly.
### Code:

{code_snippet}

### Requirements:
Generate unit test cases that cover different scenarios, including:
1. **Typical use cases and main functionalities**: Verify that the primary functions of the code work as expected under normal conditions.
2. **Various inputs and user actions**: Test the code with different valid inputs and simulate various user actions to ensure it handles all expected cases.
3. **Error handling and edge cases**: Ensure the code handles errors gracefully and behaves correctly under edge cases or unusual conditions.
### Output Format:
Provide the test cases directly in the appropriate code format. Each test case should include:
- **Test function name**: Follow the conventions of the language/framework being used (e.g., `testFunctionName`).
- **Setup and teardown** (if necessary): Include any code needed to initialize or clean up before/after running each test.
- **Test logic**: Verify the functionality of the provided code, ensuring each test case is detailed and covers specific scenarios.
- **Assertions**: Use assertions to compare the actual output of the code to the expected result.
### Constraints:
- Strictly include a maximum of 3 test cases for each function.
- Ensure all functions in the provided code are covered by the test cases.
### Task:
Given the code and its context, generate comprehensive unit test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios, adhering to the constraints.
