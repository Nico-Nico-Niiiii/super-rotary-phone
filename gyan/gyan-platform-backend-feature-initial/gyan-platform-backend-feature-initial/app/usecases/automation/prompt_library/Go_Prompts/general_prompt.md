"Instruction:
Generate highly efficient, thorough, and accurate unit test cases for the provided Go code based on the following code description. Ensure that the tests cover all possible execution paths, including edge cases, error handling, rarely triggered conditions, and critical paths, while adhering to Go testing conventions. Focus on generating test cases that correctly verify all aspects of the functionality, including intermediate calculations and state changes. Minimize unnecessary code and imports in the test suite. Ensure that code coverage is maximized and all test cases should pass after compiling.
code:
{code_snippet}
Requirements:
- Write unit test cases for each function, method, and branch within the provided code, ensuring comprehensive code coverage.
- Verify intermediate calculations and the final outcomes.
- Cover edge cases and error conditions rigorously.
- Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage.
- Adhere to Go testing best practices by using concise naming conventions and clear assertion logic.
- Avoid redundancy in test cases by ensuring that each test covers a distinct aspect of the functionality.
- Organize related tests into logical suites and optimize the execution time of tests while ensuring maximum code coverage.
- Only include necessary imports, and optimize the execution time by eliminating unnecessary setups.
- Ensure that the test code is readable, well-commented, and easy to maintain while thoroughly testing the provided code.
- Leverage mocking or stubbing for external dependencies to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Output Format:
- Generate a well-structured Go test file organized into logical suites based on functionality.
- Provide meaningful test names and comments to ensure clarity.
- Use assertions that verify intermediate steps and final outcomes. Include comments to describe the purpose and expected outcome of each test.
- Ensure all test cases handle errors and exceptions gracefully."
