### Instruction:
Given a C code snippet, generate a set of assert-based unit test cases. The test cases should:
- Cover normal execution, edge cases, and invalid input handling based on the logic of the given function(s).- - Ensure that the test cases are error-free and include all necessary standard library headers.
- The test cases must compile and run successfully.
- If the C file already contains a main function, adjust the test case generation to ensure compatibility (e.g., moving tests into a separate function, or handling tests within a conditional main function).
### Function Declaration:
- Identify the function(s) declared in the provided C code.
- Include the function declaration in the test cases file to match the signature found in the code snippet.
- This ensures that the test cases and the provided code are compatible.
### Test Case Requirements:
- Function Declaration: Include the function declaration at the beginning of the test file (copied exactly from the provided C code).
- Normal Execution: Test the function with valid inputs to verify expected outputs.
- Edge Cases: Write test cases for boundary conditions (e.g., extreme values, limits, empty inputs).
- Invalid Input: Include test cases to check how the function handles invalid or incorrect inputs, returning appropriate errors or default values (if applicable based on the functionâ€™s logic).
Assertions: Use the assert function to validate that the function behaves correctly under various scenarios.
### Handling main Function:
- If the original C file contains a main function, generate tests in a separate function (e.g., test_cases()) and conditionally call it from main if necessary, ensuring that tests do not interfere with the original logic.
Ensure that the file compiles and runs correctly, even if a main function is already present.
### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the generated test cases only use standard libraries (<assert.h>, <stdio.h>, etc.) without external or custom header files.
- Make sure the function(s) and test cases compile and run without errors. Include all the required headers.
- No need to test non-standard or external functionality unless explicitly specified.
### Example:
If the provided code contains the function int sum(int a, int b) and a main function:

c
Copy code
int sum(int a, int b);
int main() {
    // Original main logic
}
Your generated test cases should:

Include the function declaration.
Move tests into a separate function test_cases() to avoid conflicts with the existing main function.
Call the test cases conditionally within main if necessary.
Example of how the test cases might look:

c
Copy code
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration from the original code
int sum(int a, int b);

// Separate test function to avoid conflicts with main
void test_cases() {
    // Normal cases
    assert(sum(2, 3) == 5);
    assert(sum(-1, 1) == 0);
    
    // Edge cases
    assert(sum(0, 0) == 0);
    assert(sum(2147483647, 0) == 2147483647);  // max int
    assert(sum(-2147483648, 0) == -2147483648);  // min int
    
    // Invalid cases if applicable (like overflow)
    // assert(sum(2147483647, 1) == SOME_ERROR_CODE); // overflow case (if handled)
    
    printf("All test cases passed!\n");
}

int main() {
    // Original main logic can stay here
    // Optionally run test cases
    test_cases();
    return 0;
}

### Source Code Description:

The following description pertains to the logic and functionality of the provided C source code. The model should consider this description to ensure that the generated unit test cases cover the entire logic of the source code, but should not attempt to test or use any external elements mentioned here that are not present in the actual source code snippet.
