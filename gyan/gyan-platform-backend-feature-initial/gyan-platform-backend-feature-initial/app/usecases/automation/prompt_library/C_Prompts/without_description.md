### Instruction:
Given the following C code snippet, generate a set of assert-based unit test cases. The test cases should:

- C over normal execution, edge cases, and invalid input handling.
- Be error-free and use only standard libraries.

### Copy code
{code_snippet}

### Function Declaration:
- Identify the function(s) declared in the provided C code.
- Include the function declaration in the test cases file to match the signature found in the code snippet.
### Test Case Requirements:
- Function Declaration: In your test cases, declare the function explicitly at the beginning of the test file based on its signature from the provided C code.
- Normal Execution: Test the function with valid inputs to verify expected outputs.
- Edge Cases: Write test cases for boundary conditions and unusual but valid inputs.
- Invalid Input: Include test cases to verify that the function handles invalid or incorrect inputs gracefully, returning appropriate errors or default values where needed.
- Assertions: Use the assert function to verify correctness for all test cases, ensuring the function behaves correctly under various scenarios.
### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that only standard libraries are included; no external or custom header files should be added.
- The generated test cases must compile and run error-free.
### Example:
If the C code contains the function int sum(int a, int b):

c
Copy code
int sum(int a, int b);
Your test cases should include:

Testing sum(2, 3) should return 5.
Testing sum(-1, 1) should return 0.
Testing sum(1000, 2000) should return 3000.
Make sure the test file includes the function declaration and passes all test cases successfully.

Provide a complete set of test cases in C using the `assert` function, similar to the following format:
