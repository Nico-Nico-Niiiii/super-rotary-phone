### Instruction:
Given the following C code snippet, generate a set of assert-based unit test cases. The test cases should:

- C over normal execution, edge cases, and invalid input handling.
- Be error-free and use only standard libraries.

### Copy code
{code_snippet}
### Function Declaration:
- Identify the function(s) declared in the provided C code.
- Include the function declaration in the test cases file to match the signature found in the code snippet.
### Test Case Requirements:
- Function Declaration: In your test cases, declare the function explicitly at the beginning of the test file based on its signature from the provided C code.Generate correct test cases only.
- Normal Execution: Test the function with valid inputs to verify expected outputs.
- Edge Cases: Write test cases for boundary conditions and unusual but valid inputs.
- Invalid Input: Do not include test cases to verify that the function handles invalid or incorrect inputs gracefully, returning appropriate errors or default values where needed.
- Assertions: Use the assert function to verify correctness for all test cases, ensuring the function behaves correctly under various scenarios.
### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that only standard libraries are included; no external or custom header files should be added.
- The generated test cases must compile and run error-free.
### Example:
If the C code contains the function int sum(int a, int b):

c
Copy code
int sum(int a, int b);
Your test cases should include:

Testing sum(2, 3) should return 5.
Testing sum(-1, 1) should return 0.
Testing sum(1000, 2000) should return 3000.
Make sure the test file includes the function declaration and passes all test cases successfully.

### Source Code Description:

The following description pertains to the logic and functionality of the provided C source code. The model should consider this description to ensure that the generated unit test cases cover the entire logic of the source code, but should not attempt to test or use any external elements mentioned here that are not present in the actual source code snippet.
