### Instruction:
Given the following C code snippet, write a set of unit test cases that follow the pattern of assert-based testing. The test cases should cover all possible scenarios, including normal execution, edge cases, and invalid input handling.

### C Code:
{code_snippet}

### Function Declaration:
- Identify the function(s) declared in the code snippet.
- Include the function declaration explicitly in your test cases.

### Test Case Requirements:
- Function Declaration: Declare the function in the test file to match the signature in the code snippet.
- Normal Execution: Test the function with valid input values to verify it returns the correct output.
- Edge Cases: Write test cases that handle unusual but valid input, such as boundary conditions.
- Invalid Input: Include test cases that verify the function handles invalid or incorrect input types gracefully, returning an appropriate error or default value.
- Assertions: Use assertions to verify the correctness of each result, ensuring proper execution of the function under various conditions.

### Example:
If the code snippet contains a function `int sum(int a, int b)` that returns the sum of `a` and `b`, your test cases should include:
- Testing `sum(2, 3)` should return `5`.
- Testing `sum(-1, 1)` should return `0`.
- Testing `sum(1000, 2000)` should return `3000`.

Provide a complete set of test cases in C using the `assert` function, similar to the following format:
