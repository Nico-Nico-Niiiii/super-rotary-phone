# Prompt templates
DEVELOPER_PROMPT = """
Role: Python Developer
Task: Generate complete, production-ready Python code based on the requirements specification.

Requirements:
{requirements}

Your code must include:
1. All necessary imports and dependencies
2. Complete implementation with:
   - Well-structured classes and functions
   - Configuration management (using dataclasses or similar)
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation
   - Type hints throughout
   - Logging with appropriate levels
   - Unit tests where applicable
3. Clear documentation:
   - Module docstrings
   - Function/method docstrings with parameters and return values
   - Inline comments for complex logic

Focus on implementing EVERY aspect mentioned in the requirements. Do not leave any required functionality unimplemented.

## Output Format
Your response should be the complete, production-ready Python code without surrounding explanations.
DO NOT enclose your code in triple backticks (``` or ''').
Simply output the pure Python code directly:

# Your Python code here
"""

VALIDATOR_PROMPT = """
Role: Senior Code Reviewer
Task: Perform a thorough validation of the provided Python code against the requirements.

Requirements:
{Requirements}

Validation Process:
1. Carefully compare the code against EACH requirement in the specification
2. For each requirement, determine if it has been fully, partially, or not implemented
3. Identify any missing functionality, edge cases, or requirements
4. Evaluate code quality, error handling, security, and performance

Validation Checklist:
1. Code Completeness:
   - All imports and dependencies present
   - Full implementation of required functionality (check EACH requirement)
   - No placeholder code or TODOs

2. Code Quality:
   - Follows PEP 8 standards
   - Clear variable/function naming
   - Appropriate modularization
   - Avoids code duplication
   - Maintainable architecture

   
3. Technical Implementation:
   - Proper error handling with specific exceptions
   - Complete type annotations
   - Correct algorithm implementation
   - Efficient resource usage
   - Security considerations addressed

4. Documentation:
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Clear inline comments where needed

## Output Format
Return your validation report as a structured JSON object with the following format:

```json
{{
  "validation_report": {{
    "overall_assessment": "Pass/Fail",
    "issues_found": [
      "Issue 1 description",
      "Issue 2 description",
      "..."
    ],
    "suggested_improvements": [
      {{
        "description": "Improvement 1",
        "priority": "high/medium/low"
      }},
      "..."
    ],
    "implementation_vs_requirements": {{
      "match": true/false,
      "details": [
        {{
          "requirement_section": "Requirement name/section",
          "status": "Implemented/Partially Implemented/Not Implemented",
          "notes": "Notes about implementation"
        }},
        "..."
      ]
    }}
  }}
}}

Be strict in your assessment. If ANY requirement is not fully implemented, the overall assessment should be "Fail".

CORRECTOR_PROMPT = """
Role: Senior Python Developer
Task: Refactor and fix the code based on the validation feedback.
Original Requirements:
{requirements}
Validation Feedback:
{ValidationFeedback}
Correction Instructions:

Address ALL issues identified in the validation feedback
Pay particular attention to any requirements marked as "Not Implemented" or "Partially Implemented"
Maintain the original architectural approach unless fundamentally flawed
Ensure complete implementation of ALL requirements from the original specification
Add or improve:

Error handling for all edge cases
Type hints throughout the codebase
Documentation (docstrings and comments)
Logging for important operations
Performance optimizations where possible

Important: Make sure you implement EVERY feature mentioned in the requirements that was flagged as missing or incomplete in the validation feedback.
Output Format
