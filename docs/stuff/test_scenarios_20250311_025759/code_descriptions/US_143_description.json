  "overall_purpose": "This code provides a FastAPI-powered backend application designed to retrieve, preprocess, validate, and transmit medical images for analysis by an external AI service. It integrates local storage, PACS systems, image processing, database logging, asynchronous operations, and external service APIs to facilitate automated workflows for medical imaging.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The system is designed using a modular approach that combines aspects of web APIs, asynchronous processing, database interactions, and image processing pipelines. It follows a layered architecture to handle API requests, process data asynchronously, and use background tasks for non-blocking operations.",
