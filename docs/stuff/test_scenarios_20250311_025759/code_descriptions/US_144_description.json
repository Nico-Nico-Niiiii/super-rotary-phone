  "overall_purpose": "This code defines an image data validation system, implemented as a RESTful Flask API, which handles the validation of image files (JPEG, BMP, PNG, and DICOM) by checking file format, size, metadata, and corruption. The system also logs validation results into an SQLite database, optionally uploads valid files to AWS S3, and provides APIs to retrieve validation logs.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The application is a modular Flask-based system that integrates file validation, database operations, and AWS S3 file uploads under a service-oriented structure. Validation operations are encapsulated in a dedicated engine class, while logging and file management rely on utility functions.",

  "input_handling": "Inputs are handled via HTTP requests. Files are uploaded using the 'files' field in a multipart form, and metadata is extracted from the request's form data.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs are delivered as JSON responses: validation results for the upload endpoint and log entries for the logs endpoint. Log messages and errors are also stored in SQLite and logged to the application logger.",
