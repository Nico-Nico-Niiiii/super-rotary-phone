  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code is structured as a FastAPI web application with three main functionalities: image validation, DICOM metadata extraction, and image preprocessing simulation. Validation includes resolution checks, blank detection, and DICOM duplicate detection, utilizing Redis for caching duplicate checks. The architecture separates validation logic into helper functions, allowing modular functionality for image processing.",
