  "overall_purpose": "This code implements a RESTful API using FastAPI to handle upload, validation, and cloud storage of datasets. It supports role-based access control (RBAC) for secure dataset upload and manages dataset validation tasks like folder structure and image validation, followed by uploading to AWS S3 and triggering subsequent operations.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code is modular with clearly defined responsibilities for each component. It uses an event-driven approach with background tasks for asynchronous processing and follows the RESTful API paradigm.",

  "data_flow": "1. A client uploads a zip file to the `/api/upload-dataset` endpoint.\n2. The upload is validated and extracted temporarily.\n3.

  "input_handling": "Inputs include form data (`dataset_type` and `file`) and authorization tokens for RBAC. The file is validated as a zip file and its size is checked before any processing.",

  "error_handling": "The code raises HTTP exceptions with specific status codes for cases like invalid tokens (403), large files (400), or internal server errors (500). Additionally, exceptions are logged for debugging.",
