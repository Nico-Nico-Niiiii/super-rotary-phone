  "overall_purpose": "This Python script provides a complete solution for preprocessing image files, including input validation, decoding, resizing, normalization, and routing for both training and inference use cases. It also supports batch processing of images using Dask for parallel computation.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The architecture is modular, with distinct functional components handling specific tasks (validation, decoding, resizing, normalization, and routing). Utility functions are provided for logging and error handling. Batch processing capabilities are implemented using Dask.",

      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Decodes image files into NumPy arrays.",
      "functionality": "Uses the PIL library to open and convert images to RGB format while verifying their integrity. Handles corrupted or unsupported files by raising appropriate exceptions."

      "name": "resize_image",
      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Resizes images to a given resolution while maintaining aspect ratio with padding.",

      "name": "normalize_image",
      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Normalizes pixel values based on specific mean and scaling factors, and converts the image to the chosen datatype.",

  "data_flow": "The input validation function ensures acceptable parameters for an image file and preprocessing settings. Images flow through decoding, resizing, and normalization stages before being routed to an endpoint. For batches, the images are processed in parallel using a Dask bag pipeline.",
  "input_handling": "Inputs include an image file path, resolution as a dictionary (width and height), pixel datatype, use case ('training' or 'inference'), and other processing properties. Validation occurs upfront to ensure correctness.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs include processed images (in NumPy array format), results in batch processing (success/error dictionaries), and logs for routing or errors. No images are saved to disk; the processed data is returned or sent to external endpoints.",
  "error_handling": "Error handling involves logging messages at appropriate levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and raising exceptions for fatal issues. A utility `log_and_raise` function centralizes error reporting and exception raising.",

    "The routing logic is stubbed and does not perform actual HTTP or gRPC communication.",
    "No GPU-based acceleration for image processing tasks (e.g., resizing).",
    "Limited support for image files; unsupported files raise exceptions without fallback handling."
