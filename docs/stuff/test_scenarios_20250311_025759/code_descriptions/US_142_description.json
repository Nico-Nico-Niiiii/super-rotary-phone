  "overall_purpose": "This Python script processes image files in batches, validates their paths and formats, extracts image data (including converting DICOM formats), and sends them to an external validation module for further processing. It incorporates multi-threading for efficient batch processing and robust error logging.",

Extracted data is processed and optionally sent to an external validation module. Results are aggregated in a structured BatchResult object and logged to a JSON file.",

  "output_handling": "Processed image files are recorded in logs, and structured batch results are returned to the caller, either for direct use or further processing.",
  "error_handling": "The code includes robust error logging mechanisms through the `log_event` function. It gracefully handles corrupted images, invalid file paths, unsupported formats, and network issues by logging detailed error messages without disrupting overall execution.",
