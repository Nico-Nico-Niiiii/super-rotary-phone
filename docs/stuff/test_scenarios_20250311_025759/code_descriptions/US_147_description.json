  ],
  "data_flow": "The system starts with the dataset path input provided by the user. It validates the dataset and extracts metadata through InputHandler. BatchCreation then segments the data into smaller units. Images from these batches are processed (resized, normalized) in parallel through Preprocessor, while Logger records corrupted files and batch details. Finally, TrainingStepCalculator computes the total training steps required. Process results are logged and saved at the end.",
  "input_handling": "Inputs include dataset directory path, batch size, and optional preprocessing configuration. InputHandler validates and extracts relevant data from the directory provided.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs include preprocessed image arrays, log files detailing corrupted files, missing labels, and batch metadata, and the total number of training steps required.",
  "error_handling": "The system handles errors by logging corrupted files during image preprocessing, raising exceptions for invalid paths or batch size inputs, and catching general exceptions during pipeline execution to ensure graceful termination.",
