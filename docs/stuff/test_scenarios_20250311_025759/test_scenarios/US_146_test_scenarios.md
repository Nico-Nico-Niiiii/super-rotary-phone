## Test Scenarios

### TS-US_146-001: Validate input parameters for different image formats and resolutions

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Check the input validation function for various combinations of image formats, resolutions, and pixel datatypes.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure that the input validation logic correctly identifies valid and invalid configurations.

**Expected Outcome:**
Valid inputs should return a success status, while invalid inputs should return a detailed error message indicating the issue.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 1, 2

### TS-US_146-002: Decode supported image formats to NumPy array

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Test the ability to decode images in supported formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) into NumPy arrays.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that images are correctly decoded and converted into NumPy arrays without errors.

**Expected Outcome:**
Successfully decoded images should be returned as NumPy arrays with appropriate dimensions and dtype.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 1

### TS-US_146-003: Resize images with extreme aspect ratios while maintaining proportions

**Category:** edge_case

**Description:**
Test the resizing function with images of extremely wide or tall aspect ratios.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure that the resizing logic preserves the original aspect ratio and appropriately pads to the target resolution.

**Expected Outcome:**
Images are resized to the target resolution with no distortion, and the original aspect ratio is preserved with padding as needed.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 2

### TS-US_146-004: Normalize images using standard mean and scaling factors

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Test the normalization function by applying mean subtraction, scaling, and datatype conversion on varied image inputs.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that image data is normalized correctly as per the specified transformations and pixel datatype.

**Expected Outcome:**
Normalized pixel values should fall within the defined range, and the datatype should match the specified pixel datatype.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 3

### TS-US_146-005: Process a batch of images in parallel using Dask

**Category:** performance

**Description:**
Test batch processing functionality with a large set of valid and invalid image inputs.

**Test Objective:**
Measure the system's ability to process images in parallel, ensuring successful images are processed and errors are logged.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system should process valid images successfully while logging errors for invalid ones without crashing. The batch processing should be completed within acceptable time limits.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 4, 5

### TS-US_146-006: Handle unsupported image formats or corrupted files

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Test the decoding function's ability to handle incorrect file formats or corrupted images.

**Test Objective:**
Confirm that the system gracefully handles errors by skipping invalid images and logging appropriate error messages.

**Expected Outcome:**
Unsupported or corrupted files should not halt the pipeline; an error should be logged, and the system should continue processing other images.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 1

### TS-US_146-007: Simulate routing of preprocessed data to different endpoints

**Category:** integration

**Description:**
Test the routing function for different use cases (training, inference) and supported communication protocols (HTTP, gRPC).

**Test Objective:**
Verify that processed images are routed to the correct endpoint based on the use case and protocol.

**Expected Outcome:**
Training data should be routed to batch creation, and inferencing data should be routed to model inferencing. Unsupported protocols should log appropriate warnings.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 4, 5

### TS-US_146-008: Resize and normalize images exceeding resolution and bit representation limits

**Category:** edge_case

**Description:**
Ensure that the system properly handles images that exceed resolution and bit representation limits.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that such images are identified, logged as errors, and skipped during processing.

**Expected Outcome:**
Images with out-of-bounds resolutions or unsupported bit representations should return an error indicating the specific issue.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 1, 2
