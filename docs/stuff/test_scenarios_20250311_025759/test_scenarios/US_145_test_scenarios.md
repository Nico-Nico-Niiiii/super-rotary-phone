# Test Scenarios for US_145

## Summary
This test suite validates the core functionality, edge cases, and error handling for the image quality validation module. It includes tests for resolution checks, blank image detection, DICOM-specific duplicate detection, and integration of validated images with preprocessing workflows.

## Test Coverage
### Functional Areas
- Resolution validation
- Blank image detection
- Duplicate DICOM detection
- Integration with preprocessing module

### Edge Cases
- Unsupported image formats
- Empty datasets
- Corrupted DICOM files

### Areas Not Covered
- Performance under high loads (e.g., 10,000 images in a single batch)
- Scalability across distributed systems

## Test Scenarios

### TS-US_145-001: Validate images with resolution >= 512x512

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Ensure images with resolution meeting or exceeding the minimum requirement pass validation successfully.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that the validation system correctly identifies valid images and does not flag them with resolution-related errors.

**Expected Outcome:**
Image validation should return a success status with no errors for images >= 512x512 in resolution.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 1

### TS-US_145-002: Validate images with resolution < 512x512

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Check that images failing the resolution requirement are marked as invalid and return the appropriate error message.

**Test Objective:**
Verify the system correctly flags and reports images that do not meet minimum resolution requirements.

**Expected Outcome:**
Image validation should return an error message stating the resolution is below the required minimum.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 2

### TS-US_145-003: Detect blank images during validation for training datasets

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Ensure blank images in training datasets are detected and flagged properly with corresponding messages.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that completely blank or predominantly blank images are rejected from training datasets with clear error communication.

**Expected Outcome:**
Blank images should be flagged, removed from the training batch, and an appropriate error message returned.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 3

### TS-US_145-004: Detect blank images during validation for inferencing

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Validate that blank images provided for AI inferencing are flagged and not processed.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure that the system rejects blank images during inferencing and provides the correct error message.

**Expected Outcome:**
Blank images provided for inferencing should return an error message indicating they cannot be processed.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 4

### TS-US_145-005: Detect duplicate DICOM files in a training dataset

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Ensure duplicate SOP Instance UID entries are detected and flagged properly in training datasets.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that duplicate DICOM images in training datasets are removed and the corresponding error message is returned.

**Expected Outcome:**
Duplicate DICOM images should be flagged and an error message mentioning the duplicate SOP Instance UID should be returned.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 5

### TS-US_145-006: Handle corrupted DICOM files

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Ensure corrupted DICOM files are gracefully handled by the validation process.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that the system detects corrupted or unreadable DICOM files and returns an appropriate error message.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system should return an error message indicating that the DICOM file is invalid or corrupted.

**Relevant Requirements:** 7.2 Edge Case - Corrupted DICOM Metadata

### TS-US_145-007: Support for only valid file formats (JPEG, PNG, DICOM)

**Category:** edge_case

**Description:**
Validate that unsupported file formats are rejected with appropriate error messages.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure the system only processes JPEG, PNG, and DICOM formats and blocks other file types.

**Expected Outcome:**
Image validation should return an error message for unsupported file formats.

**Relevant Requirements:** 7.2 Edge Case - Unsupported Image Format

### TS-US_145-008: Push validated images for preprocessing

**Category:** integration

**Description:**
Ensure that validated images are successfully passed to the preprocessing module.

**Test Objective:**
Verify the correct handoff of validated images to the preprocessing module upon successful validation.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system should return a success status after validated images are sent for preprocessing.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 6
