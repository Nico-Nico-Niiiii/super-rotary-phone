    {
      "id": "US_141",
      "purpose": "This code implements a RESTful API using FastAPI to handle upload, validation, and cloud storage of datasets. It supports role-based access control (RBAC) for secure dataset upload and manages dataset validation tasks like folder structure and image validation, followed by uploading to AWS S3 and triggering subsequent operations.",

    {
      "id": "US_142",
      "purpose": "This Python script processes image files in batches, validates their paths and formats, extracts image data (including converting DICOM formats), and sends them to an external validation module for further processing. It incorporates multi-threading for efficient batch processing and robust error logging.",

      "id": "US_143",
      "purpose": "This code provides a FastAPI-powered backend application designed to retrieve, preprocess, validate, and transmit medical images for analysis by an external AI service. It integrates local storage, PACS systems, image processing, database logging, asynchronous operations, and external service APIs to facilitate automated workflows for medical imaging.",

    {
      "id": "US_144",
      "purpose": "This code defines an image data validation system, implemented as a RESTful Flask API, which handles the validation of image files (JPEG, BMP, PNG, and DICOM) by checking file format, size, metadata, and corruption. The system also logs validation results into an SQLite database, optionally uploads valid files to AWS S3, and provides APIs to retrieve validation logs.",
