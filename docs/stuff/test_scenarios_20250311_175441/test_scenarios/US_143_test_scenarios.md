## Test Scenarios

### TS-US_143-001: Retrieve images from PACS using a valid Patient ID

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Verify that the system can successfully retrieve images from PACS when a valid Patient ID is provided.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure the system interacts with the PACS endpoint, retrieves multiple images linked to the Patient ID, and processes them for validation.

**Expected Outcome:**
All images linked to the provided Patient ID are retrieved and validated successfully, and a confirmation message with metadata is returned.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 1 and 4

### TS-US_143-002: Handle missing Patient ID during retrieval

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Validate that the system responds appropriately when a request is sent without a Patient ID.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure proper error handling for missing mandatory inputs, specifically Patient ID.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system returns a HTTP 400 error with a descriptive message indicating that the Patient ID is missing.

**Relevant Requirements:** Input Handling Details

### TS-US_143-003: Error message for Patient ID not found in PACS

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Verify that when an invalid or non-existent Patient ID is provided, the system responds with an appropriate error message.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure the system can query PACS, identify missing Patient IDs, and respond with a user-friendly error message.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system returns a HTTP 404 error stating that the Patient ID is not found in PACS.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 2

### TS-US_143-004: Handle missing image records for valid Patient ID

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Test the scenario where a valid Patient ID exists in PACS but no image records are associated with it.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure the system handles cases of zero image records gracefully and informs the user.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system returns a HTTP 404 error with an appropriate message stating no image records were found for the Patient ID.

**Relevant Requirements:** Acceptance Criteria 3

### TS-US_143-005: Validate image format and metadata completeness

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Test that retrieved images are successfully validated for format, integrity, and metadata completeness.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that the system checks file formats (e.g., DICOM, JPEG), computes checksums, and validates presence of metadata such as study date and resolution.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system accepts valid images and logs validation failures for invalid images.

**Relevant Requirements:** Technical Requirements 2 and Validation Component

### TS-US_143-006: Preprocess images successfully for AI inferencing

**Category:** integration

**Description:**
Verify that validated images are successfully preprocessed and packaged for AI compatibility.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure the preprocessing function resizes images to 256x256, converts to RGB, enhances contrast, and saves them in JPEG format.

**Expected Outcome:**
Preprocessed images are stored, ready for AI integration, and their file paths are returned to the user.

**Relevant Requirements:** Technical Requirements 2, Preprocessing Details

### TS-US_143-007: Retry mechanism for PACS retrieval failure

**Category:** edge_case

**Description:**
Evaluate how the system handles PACS retrieval failures due to network instability or service downtime.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure the exponential backoff algorithm retries the PACS query up to 3 times before failing gracefully.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system retries with increasing intervals, logs the errors if retries fail, and returns a user-friendly error message.

**Relevant Requirements:** Technical Requirements 3, Notable Algorithm: Exponential Backoff

### TS-US_143-008: Transmit preprocessed images to AI service

**Category:** integration

**Description:**
Verify that the system can successfully send preprocessed images to the AI service endpoint.

**Test Objective:**
Test the asynchronous HTTP POST request handling, retry mechanism, and response handling for success or failure from the AI service.

**Expected Outcome:**
The AI service receives the ZIP/package of images successfully, and the system logs transmission status.

**Relevant Requirements:** Technical Requirements 4, AI Integration Component
