# Test Scenarios for US_142

## Summary
This test suite validates the ability of the module to extract image data from local storage or external hard drives in supported formats, handle errors gracefully, and integrate with an external validation module for inferencing. Tests cover functional correctness, alternative flows, edge cases, error handling, and integration points.

## Test Coverage
### Functional Areas
- File Path Validation
- File Format Validation
- Image Data Extraction
- Batch Processing
- Integration with Validation Module

### Edge Cases
- Empty Directory Handling
- Mixed File Types
- Corrupted Files during Extraction

### Areas Not Covered
- Retries for Network Failures in API Calls
- Scalability for Batch Sizes >100 Files

## Test Scenarios

### TS-US_142-001: Validate File Path for Local Storage

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Ensures the module accurately validates file paths in the user-specified directory.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that the file paths exist, are within the local storage, and do not contain unsafe path traversal patterns.

**Expected Outcome:**
The system correctly identifies valid file paths and rejects invalid or unsafe paths with proper error messages logged.

**Relevant Requirements:** File Path Validation

### TS-US_142-002: Process Batch of Valid Image Files

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Tests the ability of the module to process a batch of files in supported formats concurrently.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that the module extracts data from valid files in `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, and `.dcm` formats efficiently.

**Expected Outcome:**
All valid files are successfully processed, image data is extracted, and batch results summarize processed files along with any skipped ones.

**Relevant Requirements:** Batch Processing, Image Data Extraction

### TS-US_142-003: Handle Directory with Mixed File Types

**Category:** edge_case

**Description:**
Tests the module's behavior when the input directory contains a mix of supported and unsupported file types.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure that unsupported files are skipped and properly logged while supported files are processed without issues.

**Expected Outcome:**
Supported formats are processed successfully, unsupported formats result in a skip with appropriate warnings logged.

**Relevant Requirements:** Edge Case Handling

### TS-US_142-004: Extract Image Data from Corrupted Files

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Simulates corrupted files in the batch to test error handling during image data extraction.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that the system detects corrupted files, skips them appropriately, and logs meaningful error messages.

**Expected Outcome:**
Corrupted files are skipped, errors are logged with context, and the batch continues processing other files.

**Relevant Requirements:** Error Handling

### TS-US_142-005: Integration with Validation Module via REST API

**Category:** integration

**Description:**
Tests communication between the module and the external validation module after image data extraction.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure extracted image data is correctly formatted, sent via HTTPS, and validated by the external module.

**Expected Outcome:**
Successful responses are logged, and errors on API failure are handled gracefully with retry logic if applicable.

**Relevant Requirements:** Integration with Validation Module

### TS-US_142-006: Batch Processing Size Limit Enforcement

**Category:** functional

**Description:**
Tests the module's ability to enforce the batch size limit of 100 files.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that only the first 100 files in a batch are processed and users are notified of the limit.

**Expected Outcome:**
Batch processing correctly stops after 100 files, logs a warning about the limit, and processes no additional files.

**Relevant Requirements:** Batch Processing

### TS-US_142-007: Empty Directory Input Handling

**Category:** edge_case

**Description:**
Tests the module's behavior when the input directory contains no valid image files.

**Test Objective:**
Ensure that the module detects and gracefully handles empty directories.

**Expected Outcome:**
Appropriate error messages are generated, no files are processed, and the result object reflects no operations.

**Relevant Requirements:** Edge Case Handling

### TS-US_142-008: Handle Network Timeout during API Communication

**Category:** error

**Description:**
Tests how the module manages network timeouts or connectivity failures during external validation requests.

**Test Objective:**
Verify that failed API requests are logged with context, and batch processing continues for other files.

**Expected Outcome:**
Error messages for connectivity issues are logged, user is notified, and the module processes remaining files.

**Relevant Requirements:** Integration with Validation Module, Error Handling
