  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code is modularly designed, with distinct functions handling discrete preprocessing tasks such as validation, decoding, resizing, normalization, and routing. It uses a functional programming approach alongside batch processing with Dask.",

      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Normalizes image pixel values and adjusts the datatype.",

  "input_handling": "Inputs include image file paths, resolution dictionaries, pixel datatype strings, and use case identifiers ('training' or 'inference'). They are validated by the `validate_input` function, which ensures compliance with constraints.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs include processed image data as NumPy arrays, error messages for invalid inputs, and logs for routing simulations. Batch processing results are returned as lists containing status and processed image data.",
  "error_handling": "The `log_and_raise` utility function centralizes error handling by logging errors and raising exceptions. Specific exceptions are caught in modules (e.g., `UnidentifiedImageError`, `Exception`) to handle image decoding or processing failures gracefully.",
