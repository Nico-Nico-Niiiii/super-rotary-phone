  "data_flow": "Data flows through several stages: user uploads a zip file via the API; the file format and size are validated; the dataset is extracted and the structure validated; validation results are returned to the user, and AWS S3 uploads are scheduled for valid datasets.",
  "input_handling": "The API accepts multipart form data, including a dataset type and a zip file, via the `/api/upload-dataset` endpoint. Security credentials (token) are handled using FastAPI's HTTPBearer dependency injection.",

  "error_handling": "The code provides comprehensive error handling via FastAPI's HTTPException for user-facing errors (e.g., invalid file format) and logs internal failures (e.g., S3 API errors) using Python\u2019s logging library. Exceptions are caught to avoid crashes and return descriptive error messages.",
