  "overall_purpose": "This code serves as a backend system for image retrieval, processing, validation, and transfer to an AI service platform. It interacts with PACS systems or local storage, validates medical images, preprocesses them, and sends the processed output to an AI inference endpoint.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code is structured as a FastAPI web application that implements RESTful APIs to handle image retrieval, preprocessing, validation, and AI integration. It uses an event-driven approach and asynchronous handling for resource-intensive operations like image validation and AI service communication.",

  "data_flow": "Data begins as input via API endpoints. Images are retrieved from PACS or local storage, validated for structure and metadata, preprocessed for AI compatibility, packaged into a ZIP archive, and sent to an AI endpoint. Logs are stored in the database to track operations and errors.",
  "input_handling": "The inputs are handled using FastAPI model validation (`pydantic`). API endpoints expect structured JSON payloads describing patient IDs and image sources. Invalid or missing inputs result in HTTP 400 exceptions.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs include JSON responses for successful operations, including status messages and file paths of the ZIP archive created. Failures are responded with HTTP exceptions detailing the errors.",
  "error_handling": "Errors are logged using `logging` and stored in the database via the `log_error` function. Exceptions from external services and file operations (e.g., PACS service failure or local file errors) are caught and responded with suitable HTTP status codes.",
