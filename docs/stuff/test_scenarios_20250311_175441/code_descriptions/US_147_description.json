  "overall_purpose": "The module provides a pipeline for creating batches of data from a dataset of images, preprocessing these images, logging the process, and calculating training steps. It is tailored for preparing data for machine learning model training.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code is organized into modular classes, each responsible for a specific functionality, such as input validation, batch creation, preprocessing, logging, and pipeline orchestration. The pipeline utilizes parallel processing for efficient handling of image preprocessing tasks.",
    "patterns_used": [
      "Pipeline pattern - orchestrates multiple stages of a process sequentially.",

      "type": "class",
      "purpose": "Validates the dataset path, checks file formats, and extracts image file names along with their labels.",

      "purpose": "Splits the dataset into batches for model training.",

      "purpose": "Applies preprocessing steps to individual images, such as resizing and normalization.",

  "data_flow": "Data flows sequentially through major components: dataset validation (InputHandler), batch creation (BatchCreation), image preprocessing (Preprocessor), and log handling (Logger). Preprocessed image data is returned after parallel execution, and metadata is stored in logs for reference.",

  "output_handling": "Outputs include preprocessed image batches, log files (JSON format) detailing corrupted files, missing labels, and batch details, and scalar values for the total training steps.",
  "error_handling": "The module employs try-except blocks to gracefully handle errors during image processing (e.g., corrupted files) and invalid paths or configurations. Errors are logged for traceability rather than halting the pipeline.",
