  "module_name": "US_144_code.py",
  "overall_purpose": "The code implements an image data validation system that accepts image files uploaded via an API, validates their formats, metadata, and size, logs the validation results into a database, uploads validated files to an Amazon S3 bucket, and provides an API to fetch validation logs.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The application uses a modular design built with Python libraries, Flask as a REST API framework, SQLite for local database storage, and AWS S3 for cloud file storage. It follows the separation of concerns principle by organizing validation, logging, and upload functionalities into distinct components.",

      "type": "class",
      "purpose": "Encapsulates the validation outcome for a single file.",

      "purpose": "Processes a batch of image files, conducting validation and coordinating the upload workflow.",

      "name": "upload_images",
      "type": "route (Flask endpoint)",
      "purpose": "Handles HTTP POST requests to upload images for validation.",

  "data_flow": "User uploads image files and optional metadata via the `/api/v1/upload` endpoint as an HTTP POST request. Files are saved temporarily, processed through the `validate_batch` function for sequential validation. Validated files are uploaded to S3, and results are logged in SQLite. Logs can be retrieved via the `/api/v1/logs` endpoint as a HTTP GET request.",
  "input_handling": "Inputs are handled via Flask's request object. Files are uploaded using `request.files.getlist`, and metadata comes through form fields accessible via `request.form.to_dict`.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs are provided as JSON responses to API requests. Validation results, including success and error messages for each file, are returned by the `/api/v1/upload` endpoint. Logs are returned as a list of records by `/api/v1/logs`.",
  "error_handling": "The code handles errors with specific error codes for validation (e.g., `ERROR_CODES`) and logs exceptions internally using Python's `logging` module. It gracefully falls back to general error handling for uncaught exceptions, ensuring meaningful error responses via JSON.",

  "configuration": "The application is configured with constants such as `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` (50 MB), `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, and `UPLOAD_FOLDER` for temporary uploads. Database connection is set through `DATABASE_FILE`, while error codes (`ERROR_CODES`) define various failure types.",
