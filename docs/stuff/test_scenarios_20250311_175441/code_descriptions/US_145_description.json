  "overall_purpose": "The code provides an image quality validation framework, designed to validate medical and general images for resolution, blank detection, and duplicate DICOM file detection. It leverages FastAPI to expose REST endpoints for interacting with the system and uses Redis for caching duplicate detection results.",
