  "module_name": "US_144_code.py",
  "overall_purpose": "An image data validation system that performs file validation (format, size, metadata, corruption) for images including DICOM and common image formats (JPEG, BMP, PNG). It also supports batch processing of image files, uploading validated files to AWS S3, logging validation outcomes in SQLite, and fetching validation logs via REST APIs built using Flask.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The system is built as a RESTful web service, combining Flask for API endpoints, SQLite for local data logging, and AWS S3 for file storage. It uses layered validation logic encapsulated in a class-based architecture with external library dependencies.",

      "type": "class",
      "purpose": "Handles various validation steps for image files.",
      "functionality": "Provides static methods for validating image format, file size, and metadata. Supports both DICOM and generic image formats using PIL and pydicom libraries to check file integrity and metadata requirements."

      "purpose": "Sets up SQLite tables for validation logs and uploaded files.",

      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Processes a batch of uploaded files for validation.",

  "data_flow": "User uploads files and metadata via the `/api/v1/upload` endpoint. Files are stored temporarily, and the system validates them sequentially in chunks. Metadata and file size checks are performed alongside AWS S3 upload attempts. Validation outcomes are logged into SQLite, and users can retrieve logs via the `/api/v1/logs` endpoint.",
  "input_handling": "Files are handled as temporary uploads in a designated folder (`temp_uploads`) and accessed using Flask's `request.files.getlist()` API. Metadata is also extracted from the HTTP request form data.",
  "output_handling": "Validation results are formatted as dictionaries and returned as a JSON response to the `/api/v1/upload` endpoint. Logs retrieved via `/api/v1/logs` are returned in tabular format as JSON objects.",
  "error_handling": "Comprehensive error handling is implemented using try-except blocks. Validation errors (e.g., unknown format, missing metadata, file corruption) are mapped to predefined error codes and logged. Unexpected errors during upload, database operations, or S3 communication are caught and reported via centralized logging.",

These can be modified by changing the constants in the code.",
