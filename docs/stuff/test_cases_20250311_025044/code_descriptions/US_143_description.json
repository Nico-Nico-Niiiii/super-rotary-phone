  "overall_purpose": "The code is designed to process medical images retrieved from a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) or local storage, validate them, preprocess them for AI inference, and send them to an AI service for further analysis. It also includes logging, error handling, database integration, and API endpoints for user requests.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The architecture is based on FastAPI for RESTful service implementation, with asynchronous operations for scalability. It integrates external services (PACS and AI inference), databases for logging and metadata storage, and local file handling for image processing.",

  "data_flow": "Patient data flows from user input via API requests. Images are retrieved (from PACS or local storage), validated, preprocessed, packaged, and sent to the external AI service while metadata is stored in the database. Logs are created for errors and events throughout the process.",
  "input_handling": "The REST API accepts JSON payloads conforming to Pydantic models to validate input data. Input handling ensures required fields like patient_id and source are present.",
  "output_handling": "Responses are sent in JSON format with status messages, error details (if applicable), and paths to generated files (e.g., zip file with preprocessed images).",
  "error_handling": "Errors are logged in both the application log file and database using the 'log_error' function. HTTPExceptions are raised for client-side and server-side issues, ensuring proper error responses for API consumers.",

  "limitations": [
    "Hardcoded database URL has limited flexibility and demands manual updates for environment changes.",
    "Image preprocessing is limited to resizing and contrast enhancement; more complex transformations might be needed for specific AI models.",
