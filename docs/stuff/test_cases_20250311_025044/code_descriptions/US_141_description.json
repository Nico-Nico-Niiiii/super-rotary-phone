Valid datasets are uploaded to AWS S3 and post-upload tasks are scheduled. Validation results are returned to the client, detailing any issues.",
  "input_handling": "Inputs are handled through FastAPI's dependency injection and form submission mechanisms. The user uploads a zip file and specifies the dataset type (classification or segmentation). Uploaded files are read into memory, validated, and temporarily stored for further processing.",

  "error_handling": "The code uses HTTPException to handle errors such as invalid file formats, oversized files, invalid tokens, insufficient permissions, and unexpected exceptions during processing. Additionally, error logs are recorded using Python's logging module with traceback information for debugging.",
