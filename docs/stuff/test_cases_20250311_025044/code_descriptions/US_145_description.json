  "overall_purpose": "This code implements an image validation system using FastAPI. It validates medical images, ensuring compliance with resolution requirements, detecting blank images, identifying duplicate DICOM files, and extracting metadata from DICOM files. It provides endpoints to process and validate these images as part of a medical image preprocessing pipeline.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The system is structured as a web application powered by FastAPI. It uses several helper functions for image validation and metadata extraction and organizes the workflow with separate endpoints for different functionalities. Redis is integrated for caching SOP Instance UID to prevent duplicate DICOM submissions.",
