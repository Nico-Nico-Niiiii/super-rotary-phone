  "module_name": "US_142_code.py",
  "overall_purpose": "This code is an image processing module designed to validate and extract image data from various file formats and communicate with a remote validation module over REST API for further processing. It handles file sorting, extraction, validation, and error logging for digital image files, including DICOM medical imaging formats.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code employs a modular architecture with distinct separation of concerns. Utility functions handle file validations and logging, while classes encapsulate file metadata and batch results. Concurrent processing of files is achieved using a ThreadPoolExecutor to optimize performance over large batches.",

Valid files are extracted, transformed into byte data, and optionally sent to a remote validation module. Logs and batch results are stored for tracking successes, skips, and errors.",
