  "overall_purpose": "This Python script provides a modular framework for image preprocessing, including validation, decoding, resizing, normalization, and routing. It supports batch processing for scalability, making it suitable for machine learning workflows like training and inference.",
  "architecture": {
    "description": "The code follows a modular and procedural architecture where each preprocessing stage is encapsulated in separate functions for validation, decoding, resizing, normalization, and routing. Batch processing is implemented using Dask to enable parallel processing.",

      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Decodes an image file into a NumPy array.",

      "name": "resize_image",
      "type": "function",
      "purpose": "Resizes an image to the specified resolution while maintaining its aspect ratio.",

  ],
  "data_flow": "The system processes data sequentially, starting with input validation, followed by image decoding, resizing, normalization, and routing. Batch processing uses Dask for parallelism and the results are returned as a list.",
  "input_handling": "Inputs include image file paths, resolution parameters, pixel datatypes, and use case specifications. These are validated and logged before further processing.",
  "output_handling": "Outputs consist of processed images (as NumPy arrays) and metadata on processing status (success or error). In the routing stage, images are sent to specified endpoints.",
  "error_handling": "Errors are handled using the utility function 'log_and_raise', which logs the error and raises an exception. Validation errors return descriptive messages, enabling graceful degradation during processing.",
