This code serves as an integration layer that coordinates all the individual modules.
Each module's code is stored in separate files named by their user story IDs with "_code.py" suffix.
The integration is based on detailed analysis of function and class relationships between modules.

Integrated Solution for Dataset Upload, DICOM Processing, and Image Analysis

This script integrates functionality from three modules:
1. US_141_code.py: Handles dataset upload and validation using FastAPI and AWS S3.
2. US_142_code.py: Processes DICOM files, validates them, and sends data to a validation API.
3. US_143_code.py: Processes images retrieved from PACS, sends them to an AI module, and validates responses.

The integration coordinates the flow of data between these modules, ensuring proper sequencing and dependency management.

Function Relationship Map:
- US_141_code.upload_dataset -> Handles dataset upload and validation.
- US_142_code.DICOMProcessor.process_batch -> Processes DICOM files in batches.
- US_143_code.process_image -> Processes images retrieved from PACS and sends them to the AI module.

Main Execution Flow:
1. Upload and validate datasets using US_141_code.
2. Process DICOM files using US_142_code.
3. Process images using US_143_code.
